title: What is DevOps
---

There are several ways to look at the DevOps "brand" and even in my circle of
collegues, there isn't a a absolute true.

Found this on the web and looked pretty cool.

```
Four friends sitting round a table, one pips up and says "I want to work in DevOps"... The other three are seasoned IT professionals reply:

    So you want to be a UI developer?

    So you want to be a back-end developer?

    So you want to be a infrastructure administrator?

    So you want to be a network engineer?

    So you want to to be a security engineer?

    So you want to to be a database administrator?

    So you want to to be a support administrator?

Suddenly a consultant barges through the door and says: No, that's old-school and obsolete. Methods of continuous delivery means in-depth expertise in specific fields is no longer required, convergence is order of the day. He wants a role that synergies and leverages these, to deliver a paradigm shift. (Then proceeds to submit an invoice, followed by a quick exit stage left)!
