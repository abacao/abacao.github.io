Security is a big concern everywhere but not eveyone do what they preach!

There are several ways to secure your information or at least, try to difficult
that someone can aquire access to your information.

One way to do that is to enable a 2nd Factor Authenticator.

Every "cool kid" has 2nd Factor enable from the start of using anything online.
This 2nd Factor can be a SMS, Push, Phone call or even a file.

I'm using [Duo Mobile](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duosecurity.duomobile&hl=en).
It works like Google Authenticator, Authy and more but one of the things I like the most
is being able to access my server/app by using a push.

No more insert the code that is sent or generated. You just select if it was you or not.

One of the reasons I'm writting this post is to keep track of a important thing:

How to backup your Duo Mobile codes:
On Android you need a rooted phone and then copy the following file:


```
/data/data/com.duosecurity.duomobile/files/duokit/accounts.json
```
