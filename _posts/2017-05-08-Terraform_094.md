title: Terraform 0.9.4
---

Minor update on [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).

I've been on a short holidays and I was able to turn almost all my computers
off.

The only thing missing to be away from the IT world was my phone and Netflix.

Minor improvment with Terraform providing some new data sources but most
important, the fix of some bugs that were causing some damage like updating
ports in Openstack and allow users with no tags in rabbitmq.

You can find the changelog [here](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/blob/v0.9.4/CHANGELOG.md)
