As I was learning about snaps, I faced a issue that I was having in my current
job. I have been using some tools from Hashicorp and Hashicorp don't use the
"latest version" concept.

Bu if you want to keep yourself updated, it's a problem because they are 
releasing new features every couple os days and sometimes can be hard to keep
up with it, so I created my first snap.

The same package that runs in Ubuntu and Fedora and it seems that will be the
standard packaging system for the years to come.

I introduce you ["packer-abacao"](https://uappexplorer.com/app/packer-abacao.abacao) snap.

It is a job that needs to be polished but remember that is my first snap.

You can install this snap from the Ubuntu Snap Store by using the command.

```sudo snap install packer-abacao```

With this you will get the latest packer version from the source. v1.1.0

Have fun using as I'm having fun building it!
