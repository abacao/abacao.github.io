title: Snapcrafting

I and my blog were mentioned by the team of Snapcraft in "[This week in snapcraft (WW21 2017)](https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/this-week-in-snapcraft-ww21-2017/795)"

In my tries, I have explored some ways of building snaps and Ubuntu is providing a new way to do it by launching [build.snapcraft.io](build.snapcraft.io)

It seems that Ubuntu is in the right path with this one.

"If the use of SNAPs is snapping, the creation of SNAPs is snapcrafting."
