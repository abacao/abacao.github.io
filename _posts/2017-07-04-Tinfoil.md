We all should be aware that our data is valueable for us and might be valuable for others and due to that, I've decided to create a single 'script' to be able to create and destroy a VPN server on DigitalOcean to encrypt your traffic when you are using a public or a dubious internet connection.


You only need:
- a DigitalOcean token
- your ssh key id (you can see how to gain that in the repo)
- Terraform binary
- Clone the repo: https://github.com/abacao/DO_TinFoil

For more detailed instructions, you can read the repo Readme.
