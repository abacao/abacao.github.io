Some changes were in place in the last 2 months. I stop my collaboration with my previous company and I have joined Siemens in Portugal.
The goal here is to help build and maintain a secure [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/) instalation for propriety code.
I'm also helping the cloud team with hardening ansible scripts for several linux tools.

My SNAPs are a bit outdated but I will try to update them as soon as possible and also improve them.
