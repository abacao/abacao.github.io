Minor update on [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) but with interesting things added:

```FEATURES:

    New Resource: aws_api_gateway_method_settings [GH-13542]
    New Resource: aws_api_gateway_stage [GH-13540]
    New Resource: aws_iam_openid_connect_provider [GH-13456]
    New Resource: aws_lightsail_static_ip [GH-13175]
    New Resource: aws_lightsail_static_ip_attachment [GH-13207]
    New Resource: aws_ses_domain_identity [GH-13098]
    New Resource: azurerm_managed_disk [GH-12455]
    New Resource: kubernetes_persistent_volume [GH-13277]

The pace of improving Terraform is quite high in the moment (more-less 11 days between releases).

Also, [Packer](https://www.packer.io/) is finaly at v.1 - Congrats Hashicorp!
